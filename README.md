# NetworkParcellation

These set of functions are used to generate the results in paper "An exemplar-based approach to individualized parcellation reveals the need for sex specific functional networks," Salehi et al., NeuroImage 2018.

The main function is "Parcellation_rest.m", which generates the individualzied functional networks from the node-level (i.e., parcellated by grouping voxels into nodes) fMRI data. The rest of the functions are either auxiliary functions that are called by the meain function, or are used for other analyses in the paper.
